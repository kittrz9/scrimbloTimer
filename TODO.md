### todo:
 - implement timing and convert the current time to a string
 - get input for hotkeys (I don't think SDL lets you do that without the window focused, might have to directly use X11 stuff)

---

### maybe:
 - include font directly in the executable to avoid needing to use stb_image
 - move from SDL to something that can be statically linked with
 - splits
