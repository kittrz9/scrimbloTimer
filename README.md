# scrimbloTimer
a simple speedrun timer for linux using X11 and SDL3<br>
<br>
currently doesn't have the capability to save times or use splits, and the hotkeys are currently hard coded<br>
<br>
the font used is [Terminus](https://terminus-font.sourceforge.net/)

## building
to build you should just be able to run `./build.sh` in this directory.<br>
it should download a version of SDL3 and compile it, however cmake is required to build SDL3, so you will need to have that installed.<br>
